# Installation

From the root directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

# Starting and Operating

The application works entirely from the command line.

Run `npm run start` in order to transpile and start the calculator. From there, you can enter commands like `42 + 8*5` in order to replicate the behaviors of a standard scientific calculator.

Inputting a single lower-case "q" will cause the application to quit back to your command line context.
